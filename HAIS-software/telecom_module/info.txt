This project sends the data to the firebase database.
To connect this code with your firebase project, you  have to :

1- change the Config. You have to go to your database -- the main page -- create a web app. Your configuration will show there.
2- in the Config, there is a database URL you will find it in-- storage upper left corner .
3- change the (row_data, root, download) path.
4-download your own serviceAccountKey from your project sitting and rename it.

This code was tested on ( files, .pcd, .txt,.json,.png,.jpg,.gif), and it works fine.

******************** you have to adjust the way of downloading the file based on the application*************


to send the file, run "send_data.py," and that will make the infinite loop to send the data each 0.5 sec
to retrieve the data, run "read_data.py," which will download all the data in firebase to the download folder


... I hope you will have a successful project ...
